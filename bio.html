            <div>My style can be described as minimalist anchored in tradition. I am inspired daily by nature, clean lines, and open spaces that allow a key message to take center stage. "Perfection is acheived, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away," (Antoine de Saint-Exupery). This thought process guides my approach to design, as well as communication.<br><br>

                I received a Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communication in Advertising at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) in 2001. Most recently, I continued my education at UNL with a graduate certificate in Public Relations and Social Media, furthering my knowledge in social media, digital analytics, intergated marketing communication, and public relations. 
                
                I have worked in a variety of industries, both profit and non-profit. In my various roles, I have overseen a wide-variety of marketing and design efforts, ranging from graphic design to creating communication plans. As a result of working in smaller team environments, I have played an active part in every stage of marketing, from strategic planning up through implementation.<br><br> I have a passion for both design and marketing and enjoy working in positions where I can leverage both skill sets.
                
                In my freetime, I enjoy spending time with my family, expanding our pollinator habitiat, and using my social media and design skills to support a local chapter of non-profit Citizens' Climate.</div>
